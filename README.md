# The Little Taco Shop 🌮

Welcome to **The Little Taco Shop**!  
A fun, responsive, and visually appealing website for a fictional taco restaurant, built to practice and showcase modern HTML and CSS skills. Also this is my first project using HTML and CSS.

## 🌟 Features

- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices.
- **Sticky Header & Navigation:** Easy access to all sections from anywhere on the page.
- **Multiple Pages:**  
  - Home (About Us, Menu)
  - Store Hours
  - Contact Us (with a working contact form)
- **Modern UI:** Uses CSS custom properties, flexbox, and media queries.
- **Accessible:** Semantic HTML, proper labels, and navigation.
- **Fun Visuals:** Tasty taco images, animated buttons, and a scroll-to-top button.
